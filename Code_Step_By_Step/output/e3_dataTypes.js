// What is data type ?
// ==>  In a veriable what type of data will store that is data type.
var userName = "Jhantu";
var age = 23;
var isAuthenticated = true;
// Categories of data type in TypeScript
// 1. Primitive 2. Object 3. Special Types 4. Advance Types 5.Function Types
// Primitive data types ==> 1.number 2.string 3.boolean 4.null 5.undefined 6.bigint 7.symbol
// is null or undefined same ?
// If I consider an empty bottle with no water and nothing but still air is present in that that is called Undefined but If we consider no air is also present in that bottle and bottle is completely empty that is null
// Null means there is nothing in that veriable totally empty
// Undefined means till now no value is assigned means uninitilized value in future value can be assigned
var demo = undefined; // like this way we can use multiple data type for a single veriable
var temp = null;
console.log(demo);
demo = "not defined";
let temp2 = "Test data of TypeScript";
// console.log(temp2)
const syml1 = Symbol('1');
const syml2 = Symbol('1');
export {};
